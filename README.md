# Crates
This is a game meant for mobile where the player is stuck in a pit which is slowly being filled with crates. The player has to get on top of the crates and escape the level without the crates hitting the player on the head. This version is a prototype and only has two levels and no graphics. It needs a lot of work on the overall design of the game.
